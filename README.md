Otherwise build from the Unity project in either Windows or Android, iOs probably works just fine too.


# Directions

**Take Home Code Challenge**
**Code Challenge**

Using Unity and C# create a new 2D project and draw a hexagon of any color. When the
hexagon is double-clicked or double-tapped, the hexagon should change to a random color. The
hexagon should only be clickable/tappable in the bounds of the hexagon. Also, include a menu
system that allows you to switch the shape of the element. The example code should work on
mobile and desktop devices.

**Delivery**
1. Please use the latest Unity 2021 LTS to build
2. Create a public Github / Bitbucket / Gitlab repo
3. Provide the link to the repo
4. Provide source code and instructions to build
5. Provide a working demo link (or instructions to run it locally)

**Optional Challenges**

- Make the hexagon/shape animate
- Make a more complex gesture or animation
- Mask an image into the hexagon/shape
- Add some audio effects
- Add some custom shader effects
- Make a small game (programmer art more than acceptable)
- Anything else you would like to show us!

**Suggested Technology**

These libraries and frameworks may help you along the way, but feel free to use whatever you
choose fit to complete the task.
