Code Challenge
Using Unity and C# create a new 2D project and draw a hexagon of any color. When the
hexagon is double-clicked or double-tapped, the hexagon should change to a random color. The
hexagon should only be clickable/tappable in the bounds of the hexagon. Also, include a menu
system that allows you to switch the shape of the element. The example code should work on
mobile and desktop devices.
Delivery
1. Please use the latest Unity 2021 LTS to build
2. Create a public Github / Bitbucket / Gitlab repo
3. Provide the link to the repo
4. Provide source code and instructions to build
5. Provide a working demo link (or instructions to run it locally)
